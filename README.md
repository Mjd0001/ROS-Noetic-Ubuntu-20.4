## Step1: Ubuntu MATE 20.04 LTS Installation
1- First download the image from here: https://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-mate/releases/20.04/release/
2- <br>open VMWare, and select the ‘Create a New Virtual Machine‘ option as shown in the figure below.<br>

<br><br>

<br><br>
5- You can change the Virtual Machine name and the location if you want, or you can keep it as default:<br>

<br><br>
6-The next step is to assign the size of the virtual hard disk. You can safely work with 20 GB size for hard disk.
There are two options for creating a virtual hard disk. The first option is to store the virtual disk file as a single file. The second option is to split the disk into multiple files. The advantage of splitting is if you want to copy the hard disk file to another computer, you can easily copy the files. The problem with this configuration is, the performance will reduce if the disk size is very high.<br>
